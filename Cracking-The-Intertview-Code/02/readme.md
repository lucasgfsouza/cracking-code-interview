Every time a solution is built after I've read the answer, I'll leave a comment 'checked solution' in the solution file.

QUESTION:
Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other

Answers from book (after challange completed):

questions to ask the recruiter:
    Is permutation comparison case-sensitive?
    Are whitespaces significant?

Solution 1 involves sorting the strings and comparing them. According to the book, this approach is readable but not very efficient.

Solution 2 is similar to the implementation I created, which uses a data structure to save letter counts.
It is more efficient and, in JavaScript, using a hashmap makes it very readable.

In this exercise i will only build a solution (by now).
