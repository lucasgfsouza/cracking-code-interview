Repo for study the book "cracking the code interview"

Each problem presented at book will be handle at a folder; That folder may contain some solutions, made by myself before or after reading the solutions at book.
When a solution is built after I've read the solution in the book, it will receive the comment 'checked solution' to indicate that I couldn't solve it alone at that moment.

At the end of the solution file, I will leave a comment with the BigO notation and other relevant explanations.
